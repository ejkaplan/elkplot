## Scale Factor

Do not be afraid to make your artwork at whatever scale is easiest and then make a call to [`elkplot.scale_to_fit()`][elkplot.shape_utils.scale_to_fit] at the end. For example, if I'm making a drawing that is built around a square grid, I'll always make the grid cells 1 inch x 1 inch to make the math convenient, and scale at the end. Just make sure to call [`elkplot.optimize()`][elkplot.shape_utils.optimize] **_after_** you scale so that `optimize`'s `tolerance` argument is in the same scale as the drawing.
