This Python library is built to facilitate using [shapely](https://pypi.org/project/shapely/) to create generative art to be plotted with an [AxiDraw](https://axidraw.com) pen plotter. The library is MIT licensed and free for use, including modification.

I wrote _elkplot_ specifically to play nicely with my personal workflow for creating generative art, and I make it available in the hopes that other plotter artists will be able to make use of it. Feel free to check out my instagram, linked above (shameless plug) for examples of the kind of work I create using _elkplot_.
